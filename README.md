## Game Engine Features

The game engine implements full Euchre rules with comprehensive test coverage:

**Core Features:**
- ✅ Trump selection (2-round bidding with order-up and call-trump)
- ✅ Going alone support with partner skip logic
- ✅ Dealer discard after ordering up
- ✅ Bower logic (right bower, left bower)
- ✅ Suit-following validation
- ✅ Trick winner determination (3-card and 4-card tricks)
- ✅ Proper Euchre scoring (march, euchre, going alone bonuses)
- ✅ Custom error types with detailed messages

**Test Coverage:**
- 397 tests across 17 test suites
- Tests for all game phases: trump selection → playing → complete
- Edge case coverage for invalid plays, corrupt state, going alone scenarios
- AI agent tests: retry logic, illegal moves, streaming variants
- 98% statement coverage, 100% function coverage

**Metacognition Arena Features:**
- Agent confidence reporting (0-100 scale) with each decision
- Optional tools with point costs:
  - 📊 Situation Lookup (-1 pt): Query similar historical hands
  - 👥 Ask Audience (-2 pts): Poll 3 other models
  - ⚡ 50/50 (-3 pts): Reveal winning cards
- Calibration-based scoring (rewards knowing what you don't know)
- Live performance scoreboard with calibration meters
- Post-game rankings by reasoning quality, not just game outcome
